# Rust Development Guidelines

## File Structure
- Do not create `mod.rs` files. Instead, create a top level rust file matching the module name, then create a corresponding directory matching the module name.
- Each module should be in its own directory with a clear purpose.
- Use snake_case for file names.

## Code Style
- Run `cargo fmt` after writing or modifying Rust files to maintain consistent formatting.
- Follow Rust's standard naming conventions:
  - snake_case for variables, functions, and modules
  - CamelCase for types and traits
  - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Module Organization
- Keep modules focused and single-purpose
- Use public interfaces to expose functionality
- Prefer explicit imports over glob imports
- Group related functionality into submodules

## Error Handling
- Use Result and Option types appropriately
- Implement proper error types for your modules
- Use the ? operator for error propagation when appropriate

## Documentation
- Document public APIs with /// comments
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Use // for internal comments

## Testing
- Write unit tests in the same file as the code being tested
- Use integration tests for testing across module boundaries
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests

## Lib vs Main

- We should always create top level functions which are exposed in lib.rs and then leverage them within main. 
- The primary responsibility within main is integrating with the CLI system.
